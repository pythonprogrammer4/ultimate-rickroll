# ultimate-rickroll
Opens rickrolls as long as a rickroll is not open. Closes only when the victim watches the entire rickroll.
If the victim pauses the video, the rickroll will start playing again within one second. 
If the victim closes the tab, it will open again, also within one second.
If the victim tries to close the program, nothing will happen.
